# Slothisticated

Slothisticated is a browser-based, responsive reaction game for everyone! You will encounter different games, which will be selected randomly and will increase in difficulty each level you rise up! Prepare for the fun!

Much responsive, very sloth!

## The Games:
  - Game 1: Click the right circle before the countdown is at 0. 
  - Game 2: React as fast as you can as soon as the picture of the sloth appears.
  - Game 3: Repeat the pattern
  - Game 4: Do or do not press the red Button. Read Carefully!
  
 Stay sloth! More Games coming soon!
